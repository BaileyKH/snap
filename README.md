## About

SnapAI is an AI-powered React component generator that transforms natural language descriptions into fully-functional React components with Tailwind CSS. Simply describe what you want, and watch as SnapAI creates the code for you along with a live preview.

## Features

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Generation**: Utilizes OpenAI's API to transform descriptions into React components
- 👁️ **Live Preview**: See your component in action before adding it to your project
- 🎨 **Tailwind Styling**: All components use Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive designs
- 📋 **One-Click Copy**: Easily copy the generated code to your clipboard
- 💻 **Syntax Highlighting**: Clear, highlighted code for better readability
